The Book Review System is a simple web app where users can share their thoughts and ratings on books theyâ€™ve read. You can rate books from 1 to 5 stars, leave a detailed review, edit reviews, delete reviews and even filter reviews by rating or sort them by the newest or oldest. 

This application currently does not implement user authentication or authorization due to the time constraints and the focus on core features.

Built with React and Vite on the front end, Python and Flask for the backend, and MongoDB for the database, this app lets users easily submit and browse book reviews.
